For a detailed explanation of each concept and code example, refer to the `WORKSHOP_SCRIPT.md` file located in the root of this project. This file serves as a guide for the workshop.

## Project Structure

The `src` directory contains the main application code:

-   `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components, organized by the React concept they demonstrate.
-   `src/pages/`: Contains the different pages of the application, each showcasing a specific React concept.
-   `src/App.tsx`: Defines the main routing for the application.
-   `src/main.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the examples!
